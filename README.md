# VSCodex

Visual Studio Code extension to support the new codex API by OpenAI.

An _API key_ (access token) is required in order to use this extension. This token is issued by OpenAI and must be in an environment variable named `OPENAI_API_KEY`. You can alternatively specify the API key in the extension settings although this might be less secure, and is generally discouraged.

```
echo 'export OPENAI_API_KEY=********' >> ~/.bashrc
```

## Building and installing extension

```
npm install -g vsce
npm install
vsce package
code --install-extension *.vsix
```

**Shortcut**: `ctrl+enter`

### Complete snippet (`vscodex.predict`)

**Shortcut** `ctrl+alt+enter`

### Set level and complete snippet

To avoid predicting more code than needed, stop-sequences can be specified like `class`. A level can be set and modified in the extension.

- Function-level: will only complete your function
- Class-level: will only complete your class
- File-level: No restrictions
- Custom-level: User specified stop sequence.
